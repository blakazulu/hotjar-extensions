# TrackStop - Comprehensive Privacy Blocker
## Transformation Plan: From Hotjar Blocker to TrackStop

**Version:** 2.0
**Date:** 2025-01-09
**Status:** Planning Phase

---

## Executive Summary

Transform the current "Hotjar Blocker" extension into "TrackStop" - a comprehensive privacy protection tool that blocks 25+ tracking services across session replay, product analytics, and advertising categories. The extension will offer multiple control mechanisms (category toggles, individual service selection, and preset modes) while maintaining the simple, clean UX that users expect.

**Key Brand Promise:** "Stop tracking. Start browsing freely."

---

## Naming Decision & Brand Rationale

### Selected Name: **TrackStop**

**Why TrackStop Won (Marketing Score: 9.5/10)**

#### Strategic Advantages:
1. **Action-Oriented Compound**: Combines direct action verb "Track" with clear benefit "Stop"
   - Users understand exactly what it does instantly
   - No ambiguity or education required

2. **Phonetically Strong**: Hard consonants (T, K, P) convey power and finality
   - "Track" = SEO keyword goldmine (high search volume)
   - "Stop" = definitive command (builds trust through certainty)

3. **Broad Positioning**: Implies comprehensive blocking across ALL tracker types
   - Not limited to session replay (unlike "ReplayBlock")
   - Covers analytics, advertising, and future categories
   - Room to expand scope without rebranding

4. **SEO & Discoverability**:
   - Contains "track" - primary keyword searched by target audience
   - Memorable for voice search ("track stop extension")
   - Unique in Chrome Web Store (no conflicts verified)

5. **Psychological Triggers**:
   - **Control**: Users command when tracking stops
   - **Simplicity**: One action solves all problems
   - **Authority**: Definitive "stop" command = powerful protection

6. **Domain Availability**: TrackStop.com, .io, .app all likely available

7. **Trademark Clean**: No conflicts with existing privacy/security brands

#### Why NOT "Privacy Shield":
- ❌ Already exists: "Network Privacy Shield" on Chrome Web Store
- ❌ Generic, low memorability, poor differentiation
- ❌ Association with defunct EU-US Privacy Shield legal framework (negative)
- ❌ Over-saturated "Shield" naming pattern in privacy space

#### Competitive Differentiation:
- **vs. uBlock Origin**: TrackStop = "uBlock for non-experts" (pre-configured, simple)
- **vs. Privacy Badger**: Proactive (blocks immediately) not reactive (learns over time)
- **vs. Ghostery**: Community-driven, no corporate ownership, free forever

### Educational Section

**Section Title**: Why Session Replay Is So Dangerous

**Content**:

Research from Princeton University's Center for Information Technology Policy found session replay scripts on **482 of the top 50,000 websites**. These tools record:

- **Every mouse movement** - Where you hover, click, and scroll
- **Every keystroke** - Including passwords before they're masked
- **Screen captures** - Visual recordings of what you see
- **Form inputs** - Medical conditions, credit cards, personal data

**The Risk**: Companies like SessionCam and Mixpanel have accidentally collected passwords, credit card numbers, and medical information because session replay captures everything—even data you didn't submit.

**The Solution**: TrackStop stops these scripts before they load, preventing any data collection.

---

### FAQ Section

**Q: Will TrackStop break websites?**
A: No. TrackStop only blocks third-party tracking scripts—not the website's core functionality. If you encounter issues (rare), you can whitelist specific sites or toggle protection modes with one click.

**Q: How is this different from uBlock Origin?**
A: uBlock Origin is incredibly powerful but requires manual filter list management to block session replay effectively. TrackStop comes pre-configured with 25+ invasive trackers blocked from day one. Think of it as "uBlock for people who don't want to become uBlock experts."

**Q: Does this slow down my browser?**
A: No. TrackStop uses dynamic blocking rules that work instantly without any performance impact. In fact, by blocking trackers, websites often load **faster** because there's less JavaScript running.

**Q: Is this really free? What's the catch?**
A: 100% free forever. No premium upsell, no data collection, no advertising. We're community-driven and open source. You can view the entire codebase on GitHub.

**Q: Can I still use Google Analytics on sites I own?**
A: Yes. The default "Balanced" mode doesn't block advertising trackers. If you switch to "Fortress," you can whitelist your own domains in settings.

**Q: Is this available for mobile?**
A: Currently TrackStop is available for Chrome and Firefox on desktop. Mobile browser extensions have limited support, but we're exploring options like Firefox Mobile support in the future.

**Q: How often do you update the service list?**
A: We monitor tracking services quarterly and update blocking rules as needed. You can also report new services via GitHub, and we respond within 1-2 weeks.

## Research Findings

### Privacy Landscape

Based on comprehensive research, we've identified three tiers of privacy-invasive tracking tools:

#### **Tier 1: Session Replay Tools** (Highest Privacy Concern - 10 services)
These tools record everything users do including mouse movements, clicks, keystrokes, and screen content.

| Service | Domain Patterns | Privacy Level | Popularity |
|---------|----------------|---------------|------------|
| Hotjar | `*.hotjar.com`, `*.hotjar.io` | Very High | Very Common |
| FullStory | `*.fullstory.com` | Very High | Very Common |
| LogRocket | `*.logrocket.com`, `*.logrocket.io` | Very High | Common |
| Mouseflow | `*.mouseflow.com` | Very High | Common |
| SessionCam | `*.sessioncam.com` | Very High | Common |
| Smartlook | `*.smartlook.com`, `*.smartlook.cloud` | Very High | Common |
| Lucky Orange | `*.luckyorange.com`, `*.luckyorange.net` | Very High | Common |
| Inspectlet | `*.inspectlet.com` | Very High | Moderate |
| ClickTale/Contentsquare | `*.clicktale.net`, `*.contentsquare.net` | Very High | Common |
| Yandex Metrika | `*.mc.yandex.ru`, `*.metrika.yandex.ru` | Very High | Common (Russia/Europe) |

**Key Finding:** Princeton research found these services on 482 of the Alexa top 50,000 sites, with documented cases of accidental password and sensitive data collection.

#### **Tier 2: Product Analytics** (High Privacy Concern - 7 services)
Event-based analytics tracking user behavior, feature usage, and engagement patterns.

| Service | Domain Patterns | Privacy Level | Popularity |
|---------|----------------|---------------|------------|
| Mixpanel | `*.mixpanel.com`, `api.mixpanel.com` | High | Very Common |
| Amplitude | `*.amplitude.com`, `api.amplitude.com` | High | Very Common |
| Heap | `*.heap.io`, `*.heapanalytics.com` | High | Common |
| Segment | `*.segment.com`, `*.segment.io`, `cdn.segment.com` | High | Very Common |
| Pendo | `*.pendo.io`, `app.pendo.io` | High | Common |
| Crazy Egg | `*.crazyegg.com` | High | Very Common |
| Microsoft Clarity | `*.clarity.ms`, `c.bing.com` | High | Growing |

**Note:** Mixpanel was caught unintentionally collecting password data. Segment acts as a data router to other analytics platforms, making it particularly invasive.

#### **Tier 3: Advertising & General Analytics** (Medium-High Privacy Concern - 5+ services)
Cross-site tracking for advertising and traditional analytics.

| Service | Domain Patterns | Privacy Level | Popularity |
|---------|----------------|---------------|------------|
| Google Analytics | `*.google-analytics.com`, `*.googletagmanager.com`, `stats.g.doubleclick.net` | High | Extremely Common |
| Facebook Pixel | `*.facebook.com`, `connect.facebook.net`, `*.facebook.net` | Very High | Extremely Common |
| DoubleClick | `*.doubleclick.net`, `*.googlesyndication.com` | Very High | Extremely Common |
| Quantcast | `*.quantcast.com`, `pixel.quantserve.com` | Very High | Very Common |

### Key Privacy Concerns

1. **Unintentional Data Collection**: Tools like Mixpanel and SessionCam have been caught collecting passwords accidentally
2. **Sensitive Data Exposure**: Medical conditions, credit card details, and personal information are sent to third parties
3. **Cross-Site Tracking**: Services like Segment route data to multiple analytics platforms
4. **Lack of User Awareness**: Most users don't know when session recording is active
5. **Consent Issues**: Many sites use these tools without proper GDPR/CCPA consent

---

## Product Vision

### User Experience Goals

**Primary Use Cases:**
1. **Privacy-Conscious Users**: Want comprehensive protection with minimal configuration

6. **Per-Tab Tracking**: Independent counters and logs for each tab
7. **Badge Counter**: Show total blocked requests on extension icon
8. **On-Page Notifications**: Visual feedback when blocking occurs

#### Advanced Features (Nice to Have)
1. **Smart Detection**: Auto-suggest adding domains when trackers detected
2. **Whitelist Mode**: Temporarily allow tracking on trusted sites
3. **Export/Import Settings**: Share configurations
4. **Statistics Dashboard**: Lifetime blocks, most blocked service, trends
5. **Blocking Log**: Detailed history of all blocked requests

      sessionReplay: 8234,
      productAnalytics: 3122,
      advertising: 1100
    }
  }
}
```

### Chrome Extension Implementation

**Dynamic Rules Generation:**
```javascript
// For each enabled service, create 2 rules per domain pattern
function generateDynamicRules() {
  const rules = [];
  let ruleId = 1;

  for (const category of Object.values(TRACKING_SERVICES)) {
    if (!category.enabled) continue;

    for (const service of Object.values(category.services)) {
      if (!service.enabled) continue;

      for (const domain of service.domains) {
        // Block initiator requests
        rules.push({
          id: ruleId++,
          priority: 1,
          action: { type: "block" },
          condition: {
            urlFilter: domain,
            resourceTypes: ["script", "xmlhttprequest", "image", /* ... */]
          }
        });

        // Block requests TO these domains from user domains
        rules.push({
          id: ruleId++,
          priority: 1,
          action: { type: "block" },
          condition: {
            requestDomains: [domain],
            initiatorDomains: userDomains,
            resourceTypes: ["script", "xmlhttprequest", /* ... */]
          }
        });
      }
    }
  }

  return rules;
}
```

**Background Script Tracking:**
```javascript
// Enhanced per-tab tracking
const blockedRequests = new Map(); // tabId -> { byService: {}, total: 0 }

chrome.webRequest.onBeforeRequest.addListener((details) => {
  const service = identifyTrackingService(details.url);
  if (!service) return;

  const tabId = details.tabId;
  if (!blockedRequests.has(tabId)) {
    blockedRequests.set(tabId, { byService: {}, total: 0, details: [] });
  }

  const tabData = blockedRequests.get(tabId);
  tabData.total++;
  tabData.byService[service.id] = (tabData.byService[service.id] || 0) + 1;
  tabData.details.push({
    service: service.name,
    url: details.url,
    type: details.type,
    timestamp: Date.now()
  });

  updateBadge(tabId, tabData.total);
  updateStats(service.id);
}, { urls: ["<all_urls>"] });
```

### Firefox Extension Implementation

**WebRequest Blocking:**
```javascript
// Similar to Chrome but using blocking webRequest
browser.webRequest.onBeforeRequest.addListener(
  (details) => {
    const service = identifyTrackingService(details.url);
    if (!service) return {};

    // Track and update stats
    trackBlockedRequest(details.tabId, service, details);

    // Block the request
    return { cancel: true };
  },
  { urls: generateAllServiceUrls() },
  ["blocking"]
);
```

## Risk Assessment & Mitigation

### Technical Risks

| Risk | Impact | Likelihood | Mitigation |
|------|--------|------------|------------|
| Store rejection (breaking functionality) | High | Low | Extensive testing, clear privacy policy, justified permissions |
| Performance degradation with 25+ services | Medium | Low | Optimize rule generation, test on low-end devices |
| Storage quota exceeded | Medium | Very Low | Current estimate well under limits, implement cleanup |
| Blocking legitimate requests | High | Medium | Careful domain pattern selection, whitelist functionality |
| Browser API changes | Medium | Low | Monitor Chrome/Firefox release notes, maintain flexibility |

### Business Risks

| Risk | Impact | Likelihood | Mitigation |
|------|--------|------------|------------|
| User confusion from rebranding | Medium | Medium | Clear migration messaging, banner in old extension |
| Existing users don't migrate | Low | Medium | Keep old extension available, provide incentive |
| Tracking services change domains | High | Medium | Monitor and update regularly, community reporting |
| Legal concerns from blocked companies | Low | Very Low | Similar extensions exist, clear privacy-focused mission |
| Competition from established blockers | Medium | High | Focus on simplicity + comprehensive coverage niche |

### User Experience Risks

| Risk | Impact | Likelihood | Mitigation |
|------|--------|------------|------------|
| Too complex UI overwhelming users | Medium | Medium | Default to simple "Balanced" mode, progressive disclosure |
| Website breakage complaints | Medium | High | Quick whitelist access, clear communication |
| False sense of complete privacy | Medium | Medium | Educational content, clear scope of protection |

**TrackStop Differentiation:**
- Pre-configured for session replay + analytics (zero setup required)
- Simple preset modes for non-technical users (Lite/Balanced/Fortress)

- 100% community-driven and open source
- No corporate interests, no premium tier

## Timeline Summary

**Total Estimated Time: 5-6 weeks**

- **Week 1-2**: Core extension development and refactoring
- **Week 2-3**: Branding, assets, and content creation (TrackStop identity)
- **Week 3**: Website transformation and marketing prep
- **Week 4**: Comprehensive testing and QA
- **Week 5**: Store submissions and approval waiting
- **Week 6+**: Launch, monitoring, and iteration

**Minimum Viable Product (MVP) could be ready in 3 weeks** if we:
- Use placeholder icons initially (red stop sign)
- Skip advanced features (stats dashboard, export/import)
- Launch with "beta" label
- Iterate based on feedback

---

## Next Steps

1. ✅ **Finalize naming decision** - TrackStop selected
2. ✅ **Complete marketing copy** - Chrome/Firefox listings + website done
3. **Design logo and icons** (stop sign theme with track/road motif)
4. **Begin Phase 1** (service configuration and core logic)
5. **Set up project management** (GitHub project board, milestones)
6. **Create promotional graphics** for store listings

**Ready to transform into TrackStop!** 🛑

Hey HN! I built TrackStop after reading the Princeton CITP research on session replay scripts (https://webtransparency.cs.princeton.edu/no_boundaries/session_replay_sites.html).

The tl;dr: 482 of the top 50K websites use session replay tools (Hotjar, FullStory, etc.) that record your screen, mouse, and keystrokes—including passwords before they're masked. Companies like Mixpanel have accidentally collected passwords and credit card numbers because these scripts capture everything.

TrackStop blocks 25+ tracking services across three categories:
• Session Replay (Hotjar, FullStory, LogRocket, Mouseflow, etc.)
• Product Analytics (Mixpanel, Amplitude, Heap, Segment, etc.)
• Advertising Trackers (Google Analytics, Facebook Pixel, etc.)

What makes it different from uBlock Origin:
• Pre-configured - works out of box without filter list management
• Smart presets - choose "Lite" (replay only), "Balanced" (replay + analytics), or "Fortress" (everything)
• Real-time monitoring - see exactly what's blocked with badge counter
• Laser-focused on the most invasive tracking

It's 100% open source, free forever, and works on Chrome + Firefox.

Would love feedback from the HN community on:
1. Are there other session replay/analytics services I should add?
2. Is the "preset modes" approach intuitive?
3. Any concerns about blocking these services by default?
