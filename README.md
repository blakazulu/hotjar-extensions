## How It Works

### Chrome Extension

- Background service worker monitors and tracks blocked Hotjar requests
- Displays badge counter and detailed blocking statistics
- Stores protected domains using chrome.storage.sync

### Firefox Extension
- Uses **webRequest API** with blocking capabilities (maintained in Manifest V3)
- Background script intercepts and blocks requests in real-time
- Tracks all blocked requests with full details
- Displays badge counter and comprehensive blocking statistics
- Stores protected domains using browser.storage.sync

### Privacy & Performance
- All blocking happens locally in your browser
- No data is sent to external servers
- Minimal performance impact
